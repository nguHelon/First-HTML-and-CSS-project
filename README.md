# First-HTML-and-CSS-project

This is my first HTML and CSS project, it consists of simple technical designs and I used this because it has a quite challenging div positioning, making a little bit technical to sort out a responsive position for mobile devices. But anyways I tried my best and thought out some solutions for that to happen.

This is the first project I deployed on github, using github is really nice, I like version control concept and From today I made it a resolution to deploy all my projects and source code here github (shout out to them). Thanks if you viewed.
