# First-HTML-and-CSS-project

This is my first HTML and CSS project, it consists of simple technical designs and I used this because it has a quite challenging div positioning, making a little bit technical to sort out a responsive position for mobile devices. But anyways I tried my best and thought out some solutions for that to happen.

## This is my journey to becoming a full stack web developer.

This is the first project I deployed on github, using github is really nice, and I like the version control concept, it takes time to master all the commands of git but anyways I think I will be proficient on it over time. and From today I made it a resolution to deploy all my projects and source code here on github (shout out to them). Thanks if you viewed.
